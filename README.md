# Hi There, I am Simon Nyvall üëãüèª

<br />

I am a second-year Cloud Developer undergraduate. Currently, I'm not employed as I'm dedicating my time entirely to my studies and passion projects. My primary goal through my academic journey is to secure a position as a DevOps professional in Sweden.

When I'm not coding for my GitHub projects, I indulge in playing the guitar üé∏, exploring music across all genres üé∂, and diving into video games üëæ, particularly Dota 2.

- üî≠ Studying Cloud Development at ITHS.
- üå± Currently honing my skills in F#, C#, and Bash.
- üòò 2023 Goals: Advance my cloud capabilities.

    <summary>My Coding Journey</summary>
  
  ```
    My coding journey began in the gymnasium, where I was stuying technology science. 
    I was always interested in technology and how it could be used to solve problems, so coding seemed like a natural 
    fit for me.
  ```
  ```
    My first coding project was a simple fizzbuzz application in C#. 
    I remember struggling with the logic at first, but once I got the hang of it, I was able to create a program 
    that I could show to other people. 
    It was a small accomplishment, but it felt great to see something I had created actually working.
  ```
  ```
    As I continued to learn, I found that I preferred hands-on projects to traditional classroom learning. 
    I would find online tutorials or open-source projects to work on in my spare time, and I found that I learned 
    much more quickly and deeply through this kind of immersive experience.
  ```
  ```
    Of course, there have been challenges along the way as well. 
    I remember getting stuck on a particularly difficult bug in a project I was working on, and feeling like I would 
    never be able to solve it. 
    But I persevered and eventually figured it out, and that experience taught me a lot about problem-solving and 
    resilience.
  ```
  ```
    Looking back on my coding journey, I feel proud of how far I've come and excited about where I still have to go. 
    I know that there will be more challenges and setbacks in the future, but I also know that I have the skills and 
    the determination to overcome them.
  ```
